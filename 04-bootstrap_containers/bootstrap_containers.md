# Bootstrap Containers
* Containers surround all of the rows and columns
* If you want to use the grid system you start with a container and you put all of your grid elements in it i.e., rows and columns
* You can also put other content into containers
* Not all content has to be inside of containers, but if you want to use the grid system on the content then it must be in a container
