# Bootstrap Brid System

## Grids
* Bootstrap comes with a 12-column grid system
* We add our content into the 'rows' and 'columns' of this grid using Bootstrap's CSS classes
* Bootstrap will take care of the responsive work for us

## Containers, Rows, & Columns
* Containers surround the whole section of rows and columns
* Rows represent a horizontal line of elements
* Columns represent the horizontal space that elements take up in a row
